# Udacity FEND/MWS Project: Restaurant Reviews

Welcome to the _Restaurant Review_, a web-based app that tested my front end web developer skills like nothing else. From HTML and CSS to ARIA and Service Workers, this had everything you could imagine to test the skill and sanity limits of a Udacity student with little to no coding background or experience. Read on for the full set up.

_This project was done as a requirement for [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)._

## Overview
This is a very simple web app that allows its user to review the information of various restaurants in select boroughs in New York City. (The locations were preselected by whoever made this project.)

*How to Use*
Users can select restaurants to review by (1) selecting a neighborhood and (2) cuisine from the dropdown menus; they can select a marker location from the map; or they can scroll down and click on "_View Details_" to read more about a specific restaurant. 

On the Restaurant pages, each venue includes a map of its location, hours of business, address, and a few reviews.

With that, poke around, find your next brunch spot and enjoy. üç≥
